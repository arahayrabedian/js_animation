------ Proposed libraries and tech ---------------
technology:
*for animation:
	-http://velocityjs.org/ - easy to integrate with bootstrap, a big plus.
*for a state machine:
	-http://machina-js.org/ - looks lighweight and easy enough to pick up.


-- ToDo --
*Make sure the same browser is used. 
	-Chrome 55 and over is recomended, as it supports the most of EC6, so no need for babel:
	http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#typescript
*Read the papers on WWW and PageRank
*Look up for animation and state libraries
* Think of the code structure and modularity, EC6 has got good features for that, with imports and things. Initial proposal is to seperate state/animation/gui_components and not follow some kind of MVC pattern ?
